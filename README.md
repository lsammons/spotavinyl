## Spotavinyl App

  This is the CodeFellows 301 final project of Laura Sammons, Maddie Mow, Joe Double.  It is a mashup between Spotify and eBay, helping users discover vinyl records based on their Spotify listening habits.

## User Stories: MVP
    1. As a visitor, I want the site to have a clean and professional looking user interface so I feel confident about sharing my Spotify userID and password.
    2. As a visitor, I want the login process to be easy and seamless. If I don't have a Spotify UserID, I want a button that will take me to Spotify so I can sign up (and come back to the app).
    3. As a visitor, I want to have my Spotify artists presented to me in a visually appealing way, like they look on Spotify (a nice image, the artist's name).
    4. As a visitor, I want to be able to easily browse many of the artists I listen to on Spotify.
    5. As a visitor, when I click on an artist's name, I want the app to respond quickly with the results.
    6. As a visitor, I want the eBay auctions to be presented as a list so that I can easily scroll through all of them.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals
    1. As a developer, I want to make sure the app is interactive and slick.
    2. As a developer, I want to be sure the app responds quickly to all user interactions.
    3. As a developer, I would like to create an iFrame so that the results of the user's click on an eBay auction's details can be displayed within my app. I want the user to stay within my application.
